# PurpleBase

## Intro

A mini database, supporting basic CRUD SQL statements, indexes, primary keys and foreign keys.

## Quick Run

To run our database, you need first to create a `runs` directory to store DB data.

```
mkdir runs
```

Then `cd` into `src` directory, use `make` to compile our system and start using with `./main`.

```
cd src
make
./main
```
